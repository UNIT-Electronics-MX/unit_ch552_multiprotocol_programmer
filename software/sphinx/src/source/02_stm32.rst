STM32 microcontrollers
=======================


STMicontrollers is a family of 32-bit microcontrollers designed and manufactured by STMicroelectronics. They are widely used in embedded systems and IoT applications due to their low power consumption, high performance, and rich peripheral set. STM32 microcontrollers are based on the ARM Cortex-M architecture and are available in a wide range of series, each tailored to specific applications and requirements.


Getting Started with STM32
---------------------------

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to getting started with STM32 microcontrollers. It includes information on setting up the development environment, installing the necessary software, and writing code for STM32 microcontrollers.

This technical documentation is a work in progress and is an adaptation of documentation from the STM32CubeIDE and STM32CubeMX software tools. It uses the ARM-GCC compiler and visual studio code as the IDE.
