AVR Firmware Overview
=====================

The CH552 Multi-Protocol Programmer relies on the PICO-AVR firmware for correct operation. This firmware, designed to run on CH55x microcontrollers, transforms the CH552 into a versatile USB-to-ISP bridge. It supports ISP AVR programming protocol,  making it compatible with a wide range of AVR devices.

The programmer integrates seamlessly with development environments such as the Arduino IDE. It can be selected under Tools â†’ Programmer as either USBasp or a custom driver name, allowing for easy bootloader installation and firmware updates on AVR microcontrollers like the ATmega328P.

Firmware Update Procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    The following procedure assumes that the `unit_ch55x_docker_sdk` repository is already cloned on your system.
    Ensure that **Docker Desktop** is running before executing the build commands, as they rely on Docker containers for compilation.


To commence the utilization of the **CH552 USB Multi-Protocol Programmer** in PICO ASP mode, execute the following procedures:

1. Navigate to the SDK Root Directory


.. code-block:: bash

    cd unit_ch55x_docker_sdk

2. Compile the Firmware

On Linux 

.. code-block:: bash

    ./spkg/spkg -p ./examples/usb/prog/avr

On Windows:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./spkg/spkg.bat -p ./examples/usb/prog/avr

The execution of this command will generate a .bin file within the **build** directory.

WCHIspStudio Interface
----------------------

Launch **WCHIspStudio** to upload the firmware.

.. raw:: html

    <div style="text-align: center;">
         <img src="./_static/rp/wchispstudio.png" alt="WCHIspStudio" style="width: 100%;">
         <p>WCHIspStudio Configuration</p>
    </div>

- In the Object File 1 field, select the path to the generated .bin firmware file.
- Enable the option "Automatic Download When Device Connect".
- Click the ... button to browse and confirm the correct firmware path.

.. warning::

    Before connecting the CH552 programmer, **ensure the device is powered with +5V**. Use the onboard switch to select the appropriate voltage.

- Press the Boot button and connect your **Multi-Protocol Programmer** to the computer.
- Await the completion of the firmware update process.

**Completion Notice:** The firmware has been successfully updated, and the **UNIT CH552 Multi-Protocol Programmer** is now ready for use.
