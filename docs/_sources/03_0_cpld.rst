CPLD/FPGA
========================

This firmware is not an official programmer from Altera or Intel. Instead, it is a JTAG programmer for CPLD/FPGA devices based on the WCH CH552 USB microcontroller. It supports the Intel (formerly Altera) MAX II series and is compatible with Quartus Prime Lite.

    This firmware is a third-party implementation and **is not affiliated with or endorsed by Altera or Intel**. It is intended for educational, development, prototyping, and other lawful purposes only.

    Ensure that you comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using this firmware. **Use is at your own risk.** The user assumes all responsibility for any consequences, including potential legal implications. The author and distributor of this firmware **are not liable** for any damage, misuse, or legal issues arising from its use.

    **Proceed with caution and discretion.**

It is also compatible with:

- CPLD (MAX3000, MAX7000, MAX9000, and MAX II)
- FPGA (Stratix, StratixII, Cyclone, CycloneII, ACEX 1K, APEX20K, and FLEX 10K)
- Active configuration devices (EPCS1, EPCS4, EPCS16)

The ALTERA CPLD/FPGA programmer includes a USB cable and a 2.10 Core JTAG data line.

For programming Altera FPGA and CPLD devices, the Quartus software is used. A free version, Quartus Lite, is available. Quartus is the suite from Altera (now Intel) for programming, configuring, and using its products, and it fully supports the USB Blaster programmer and all its features.
