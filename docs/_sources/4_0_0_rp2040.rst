RP2040: An Introduction
========================

The RP2040 is an efficient and cost-effective microcontroller developed by Raspberry Pi. It features a dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ processor, flexible I/O capabilities, and a wide range of peripherals, making it suitable for both hobbyist and professional applications.

.. note::

    This documentation is continuously updated and incorporates key concepts from the official Raspberry Pi Pico SDK documentation.

.. tip::

    A Linux operating system is recommended, as the Pico-SDK is primarily developed and tested on Linux. However, it can also be configured for Windows and macOS with additional steps.

This guide provides a comprehensive introduction to working with RP2040 microcontrollers. It covers setting up the development environment, installing the required software, and writing code for RP2040-based projects.


CH552 Multi-Protocol Programmer
===============================

The CH552 Multi-Protocol Programmer is a versatile tool for programming and debugging RP2040 microcontrollers. It enables straightforward and reliable programming using the SWD (Serial Wire Debug) interface.

DualMCU RP2040 Programming with CH552 Multi-Protocol Programmer
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Multi-Protocol Programmer uses the SWD interface to program RP2040 microcontrollers. Follow these steps to program your RP2040 device:

1. **Connect the CH552 Multi-Protocol Programmer** to your computer via USB.
2. **Open Visual Studio Code** or another editor of your preference.
3. **Install the required extensions** for RP2040 development, such as "C/C++" and "CMake Tools".
4. **Create a new project** or open an existing one.
5. **Write your code** in C or C++ using the RP2040 SDK.
6. **Configure the build system** to use the RP2040 SDK and integrate the CH552 Multi-Protocol Programmer.
7. **Build the project** to generate the binary firmware file.
